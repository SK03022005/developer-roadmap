# What is Deepfake AI?
Famously called AI that deceives, deepfake technology takes its name from deep learning, which is a form of AI. In deepfake AI, deep learning algorithms that teach themselves how to solve problems with large data sets, are used to swap faces in videos, images, and other digital content to make the fake appear real.Deepfake content is created by using two algorithms that compete with one another.
