### LSA (MEANS) : Latent Semantic Analysis

## What is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)?
1. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) involves creating structured data from a collection of unstructured texts. Before getting into the concept of LSA, let us have a quick intuitive understanding of the concept. 
2. When we write anything like text, the words are not chosen randomly from a vocabulary.
 3. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural language processing, in particular distributional semantics, of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms.
 4. LSA assumes that words that are close in meaning will occur in similar pieces of text (the distributional hypothesis).
 5.  A matrix containing word counts per document (rows represent unique words and columns represent each document) is constructed from a large piece of text and a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among columns.
