# Vector Spaces and Norms resource
A space consisting of vectors, together with the associative and commutative operation of addition of vectors, and the associative and distributive operation of multiplication of vectors by scalars.
## Norms
A norm is the formalization and the generalization to real vector spaces of the intuitive notion of "length" in the real (physical) world.
