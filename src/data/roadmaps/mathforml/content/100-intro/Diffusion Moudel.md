In machine learning, diffusion models, also known as diffusion probabilistic models, are a class of latent variable models. They are Markov chains trained using variational inference.

# Diffusion Moudel Types
- Forward diffusion process

- Reverse diffusion process

- Parameterization of 
 Lt for Training Loss
 
- Parameterization of Î²t

- Parameterization of reverse process variance 

- Speed up Diffusion Model Sampling
