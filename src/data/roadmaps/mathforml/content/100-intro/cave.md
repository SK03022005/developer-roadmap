# CVAE (Conditional Variational Autoencoder) Resource

## What is CVAE?

Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is a type of neural network that combines the strengths of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Conditional Generative Models. CVAE can generate new samples from a given set of input conditions.

## Why we use CVAE?

CVAE can generate new images based on specific input conditions. For example, it can generate new images of cats or dogs based on input parameters such as the breed, size, or color.
