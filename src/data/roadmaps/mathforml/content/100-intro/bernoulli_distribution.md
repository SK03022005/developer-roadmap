# Bernoulli distribution
Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution in which the random variable has only two possible outcomes and a single trial known as a Bernoulli trial. p is the expected value of the Bernoulli random variable, which is known as the Bernoulli distribution parameter.
 
# Properties of Bernoulli Distribution
The mode, the value with the highest probability of appearing, of a Bernoulli distribution is 1 if p > 0.5 and 0 if < 0.5, success and failure are equally likely and both 0 and 1 are considered as modes
