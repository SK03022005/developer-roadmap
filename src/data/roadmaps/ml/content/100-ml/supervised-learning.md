# Supervised Machine Learning
Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.

# How Supervised Learning Works?
<p>In supervised learning, models are trained using labelled dataset, where the model learns about each type of data. Once the training process is completed, the model is tested on the basis of test data (a subset of the training set), and then it predicts the output...<a href ="https://www.javatpoint.com/supervised-machine-learning">Learn More</a></p>
