# What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of actions. For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, the agent gets negative feedback or penalty.

# How Does Reinforcement Learning Work?
The Reinforcement Learning problem involves an agent exploring an unknown environment to achieve a goal. RL is based on the hypothesis that all goals can be described by the maximization of expected cumulative reward. The agent must learn to sense and perturb the state of the environment using its actions to derive maximal reward. The formal framework for RL borrows from the problem of optimal control of Markov Decision Processes (MDP)...<a href = "https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/reinforcement-learning#:~:text=Reinforcement%20learning%20is%20a%20machine,learn%20through%20trial%20and%20error.">Learn More</a>
