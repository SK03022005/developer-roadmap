# Binning Spares values resources
Data binning, bucketing is a data pre-processing method used to minimize the effects of small observation errors. The original data values are divided into small intervals known as bins and then they are replaced by a general value calculated for that bin. This has a smoothing effect on the input data and may also reduce the chances of overfitting in the case of small datasets
