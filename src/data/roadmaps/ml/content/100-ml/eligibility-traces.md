## Eligibility Traces resource

## What is Eligibility Traces resource in ml?
Eligibility traces are a resource used in machine learning algorithms, particularly in reinforcement learning. They are used to keep track of the contribution of past actions and states to the current prediction or decision being made by the algorithm.Eligibility traces are used in a variety of reinforcement learning algorithms, including SARSA and Q-learning, to improve the efficiency of learning and to help the agent learn to associate specific actions with specific states in the environment.
