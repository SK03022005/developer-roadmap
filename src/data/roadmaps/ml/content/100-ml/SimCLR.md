# SimCLR
SimCLR (short for Simple Contrastive Learning) is a self-supervised learning framework for training deep neural networks, specifically designed for unsupervised visual representation learning. It is based on the concept of contrastive learning, which learns representations by contrasting positive pairs (data samples with similar features) and negative pairs (data samples with different features) in a shared embedding space.
