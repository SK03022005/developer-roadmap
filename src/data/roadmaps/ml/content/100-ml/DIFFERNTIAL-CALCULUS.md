<b>DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS<br>
Differential calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of functions and their rates of change. It involves the calculation and analysis of derivatives, which represent the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a particular point. Differential calculus is used to solve problems related to optimization, rates of change, and motion, among other applications. It is an essential tool in many fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and more.*
