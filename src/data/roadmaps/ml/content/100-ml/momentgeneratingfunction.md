## MOMENT GENERATING FUNCTION

In probability theory, the moment generating function (MGF) is a mathematical function that uniquely determines the probability distribution of a random variable. The MGF of a random variable X is defined as:

M(t) = E(e^(tX))

where E is the expected value operator, t is a real number, and X is the random variable.
