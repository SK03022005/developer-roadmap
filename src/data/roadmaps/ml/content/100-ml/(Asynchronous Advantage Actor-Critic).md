# A3C(Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic)

  A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm used for training artificial neural networks to perform a variety of tasks
  The algorithm was introduced in 2016 by researchers from Google DeepMind.
  A3C combines two reinforcement learning techniques: the actor-critic algorithm and asynchronous methods. 
  The actor-critic algorithm is a technique for training deep neural networks that allows the agent to learn both a policy (the actor) and a value function  
  The policy tells the agent what actions to take in a given state, while the value function estimates the expected cumulative reward the agent will receive from that state.
