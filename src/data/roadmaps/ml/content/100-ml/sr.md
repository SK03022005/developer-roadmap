 ## What Is Sensitivity
- Sensitivity is a measure of the proportion of actual positive cases that got predicted as positive (or true positive). Sensitivity is also termed as Recall. This implies that there will be another proportion of actual positive cases, which would get predicted incorrectly as negative (and, thus, could also be termed as the false negative). This can also be represented in the form of a false negative rate.



## What Is Specificity?
- Specificity is defined as the proportion of actual negatives, which got predicted as the negative (or true negative). This implies that there will be another proportion of actual negative, which got predicted as positive and could be termed as false positives.
.
- The higher value of specificity would mean higher value of true negative and lower false positive rate. The lower value of specificity would mean lower value of true negative and higher value of false positive.

## What Are the Differences Between Sensitivity and Specificity?
- While Sensitivity measure is used to determine the proportion of actual positive cases, which got predicted correctly, Specificity measure is used to determine the proportion of actual negative cases, which got predicted correctly.

## Where Are Sensitivity and Specificity Used?
- Sensitivity and Specificity measures are used to plot the ROC curve. And, Area under ROC curve (AUC) is used to determine the model performance. The following represents different ROC curves and related AOC values.
