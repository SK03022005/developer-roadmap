# Unbiased Estimator
An unbiased estimator is when a statistic does not overestimate or underestimate a population parameter. In other words, a value is unbiased when it is the same as the actual value of a particular parameter. There are different variables that can influence whether or not a particular sample's statistic is biased. The sampling techniques used can increase the likelihood of bias. Unrepresentative samples can lead to inaccurate estimates of population parameters.
