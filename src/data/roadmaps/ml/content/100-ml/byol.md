## BYOL

## What is BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent) resource in ML?
BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent) is a self-supervised learning method used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is a type of deep neural network architecture that learns to represent the input data in a lower-dimensional space called a latent space.The BYOL method is trained using two identical neural networks called the predictor and the target network. The predictor network takes an input image and produces a latent vector, which is then compared to the target network's latent vector using a loss function.
