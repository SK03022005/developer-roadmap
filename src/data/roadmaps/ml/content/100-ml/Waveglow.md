# **Waveglow** :-

*WaveGlow is a flow-based generative model that generates audio by sampling from a distribution. Specifically samples are taken from a zero mean spherical Gaussian with the same number of dimensions as our desired output, and those samples are put through a series of layers that transforms the simple distribution to one which has the desired distribution*.
