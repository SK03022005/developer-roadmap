# <strong>RIDGE REGRESSION</strong>
   <em> Ridge regression is a type of regularization technique used in machine learning and statistics to prevent overfitting in models</em>

# <strong>What is Ridge Regression?</strong>
   <em> Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity. This method performs L2 regularization. When the issue of multicollinearity occurs, least-squares are unbiased, and variances are large, this results in predicted values being far away from the actual values... <a href="https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-ridge-regression/#:~:text=Ridge%20regression%20is%20a%20model%20tuning%20method%20that,to%20be%20far%20away%20from%20the%20actual%20values.
