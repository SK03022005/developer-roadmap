## Radial Basis Function (RBF) 

## What is Radial Basis Function (RBF) in ML?
Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a type of machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a type of kernel function that maps input data into a higher-dimensional feature space to make it easier to classify or regress.

The most commonly used radial basis function is the Gaussian function, which gives more weight to data points that are closer together in the feature space.
