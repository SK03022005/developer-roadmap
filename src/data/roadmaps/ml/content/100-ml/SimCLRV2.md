# SimCLRV2

SimCLR (Simple Contrastive Learning for Representations) is a self-supervised learning framework that aims to learn high-quality representations from unlabeled data. It is a popular method used in deep learning for computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. SimCLRv2 (SimCLR version 2) is an updated version of the SimCLR framework, which was released in 2021.
