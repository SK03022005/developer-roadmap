Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP)
Maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) is a method of estimating the most likely parameters of a statistical model, given some observed data. The MAP estimate is found by maximizing the posterior distribution of the parameters, which is a combination of the likelihood function of the data and a prior distribution over the parameters.
