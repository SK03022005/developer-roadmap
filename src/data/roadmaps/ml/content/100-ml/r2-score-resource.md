# what is R2
The coefficient of determination, or R2, is a measure that provides information about the goodness of fit of a model. 
In the context of regression it is a statistical measure of how well the regression line approximates the actual data.
It is therefore important when a statistical model is used either to predict future outcomes or in the testing of hypotheses. The sum squared regression is the sum of the residual squared, and the total sum of squares is the sum of the distance the data is away from the mean all squared.
