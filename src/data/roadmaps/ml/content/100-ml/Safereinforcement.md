# Safe Reinforcement Learning

## What is Safe Reinforcement Learning?

Safe Reinforcement Learning can be defined as the process of learning policies that maxi- mize the expectation of the return in problems in which it is important to ensure reasonable system performance and/or respect safety constraints during the learning and/or deploy- ment processes.

## Components of Safe Reinforcement Learning:

Aside from the agent and the environment, a reinforcement learning model has four essential components: a policy, a reward, a value function, and an environment model.Now that we defined the main elements of Reinforcement Learning, let's move on to the three approaches to solve a Reinforcement Learning problem. These are value-based, policy-based, and model-based.
