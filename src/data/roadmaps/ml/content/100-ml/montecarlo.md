# Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation Resources

## What is Monte Carlo Policy?

Monte Carlo policy evaluation it is natural to alternate between evaluation and improvement on an episode-by-episode basis. After each episode, the observed returns are used for policy evaluation, and then the policy is improved at all the states visited in the episode.It sample and average returns for each state-action pair.

## Why We Use Monte Carlo Policy?

For Monte Carlo policy evaluation it is natural to alternate between evaluation and improvement on an episode-by-episode basis. After each episode, the observed returns are used for policy evaluation, and then the policy is improved at all the states visited in the episode.

## Conclusion

Monte Carlo methods learn value function and optimal policies from experience acquired by interacting with the Environment through sampled episodes. MC does not require a model of transition probabilities of the Environment and can be applied in episodic tasks.
