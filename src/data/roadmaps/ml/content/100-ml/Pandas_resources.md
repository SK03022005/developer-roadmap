# **PANDAS**:
     
Pandas is an open-source data analysis library for Python. It provides data structures and functions for manipulating numerical tables and time series. 

### *INTRODUCTION*:

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to work with relational or labeled data.

A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional table-like data structure with columns of potentially different types.

Overall, Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, making it a popular choice for data scientists, analysts, and researchers in various fields.
