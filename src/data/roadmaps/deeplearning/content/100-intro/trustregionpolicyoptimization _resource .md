# TRUST REGION POLICY OPTIMIZATION RESOURCE 
## ABOUT TRPO:
Trust Region Policy Optimization, or TRPO, is a policy gradient method in reinforcement learning that avoids parameter updates that change the policy too much with a KL divergence constraint on the size of the policy update at each iteration. TRPO alternates between sampling data through environmental interaction and updating the policy parameters by solving a constrained optimization problem.Trust Region Policy Optimization, or TRPO, is a policy gradient method in reinforcement learning that avoids parameter updates that change the policy too much with a KL divergence constraint on the size of the policy update at each iteration.
