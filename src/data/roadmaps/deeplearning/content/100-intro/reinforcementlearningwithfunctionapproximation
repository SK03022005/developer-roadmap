# Reinforcement learning with function approximation
In tabular methods like DP and Monte Carlo we have seen that the representation of the states is actually a memorisation of each state.Now letâ€™s recall what is exactly a state.A state is the combination of observable features or variables. Which means every time a feature or a variable has a new value, it results in a a new state.
