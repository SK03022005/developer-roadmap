# TD(lambda) resource
In short and a straight forward manner, Eligibility Traces is a kind of mathematical trick that improves the performance of Temporal Difference methods, in Reinforcement Learning.

Here are the benefits of Eligibility Traces:

Provide a way of implementing Monte Carlo in online fashion (does not wait for the episode to finish) and on problems without episodes.
Provide an algorithmic mechanism that uses a short-term memory vector.
Computational efficiency by storing a single vector memory instead a list of feature vectors.
Learning is done continually rather than waiting results at the end of an episode.
