# Neural Machine Translation
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a method of machine translation that uses an artificial neural network to translate text from one language to another. Unlike traditional statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, NMT models the entire translation process as a single neural network, with the input being the source language sentence and the output being the translated sentence in the target language.
