## What is WaveNet resource
WaveNet is a deep neural network-based model for generating high-quality audio waveforms.It is a generative model that can be trained to produce audio waveforms from scratch, with no need for hand-crafted features or other domain-specific knowledge. It works by modeling the conditional probability distribution of each audio sample given the previous samples in the waveform. This allows WaveNet to capture long-term dependencies in the audio signal and generate highly realistic and natural-sounding audio.
