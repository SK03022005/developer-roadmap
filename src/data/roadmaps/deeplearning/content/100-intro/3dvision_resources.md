# 3D VISION RESOURCE 
# What is the meaning of 3D vision?
Often called “3D Vision,” depth perception is dependent on the ability to use both eyes together at the highest level. 3D vision relies on both eyes working together to accurately focus on the same point in space. The brain is then able to interpret the image the each eye sees to create your perception of depth.
# Why is 3D vision important?
3D vision problems can indicate a serious eye disease.
3D vision is essential to hit or catch a ball or drive a car, and difficulties here could be due to undiagnosed vision problems. Stereopsis and 3D vision are necessary for driving and playing many sports, and contributes to a high quality of life.
