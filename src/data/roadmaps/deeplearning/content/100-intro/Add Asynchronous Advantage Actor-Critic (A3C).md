# Add Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) Algorithm resource .md

The Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm is one of the newest algorithms to be developed under the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. This algorithm was developed by Googleâ€™s DeepMind which is the Artificial Intelligence division of Google. This algorithm was first mentioned in 2016 in a research paper appropriately named Asynchronous Methods for Deep Learning.
