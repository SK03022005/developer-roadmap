#GPT-2
GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) is a language model developed by OpenAI in 2019.
It is one of the largest and most powerful language models to date, with 1.5 billion parameters.
GPT-2 is based on the Transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data, such as language.


USE OF GPT-2
- Text generation: GPT-2 can be used to generate high-quality natural language text for a wide range of purposes, including content creation
- Language translation: GPT-2 can be used to improve the accuracy of language translation systems by generating high-quality translations.
- Text summarization: GPT-2 can be used to automatically summarize long articles or documents, making it easier to extract key information quickly.
- Question answering: GPT-2 can be used to answer natural language questions by generating text that contains the answer.
