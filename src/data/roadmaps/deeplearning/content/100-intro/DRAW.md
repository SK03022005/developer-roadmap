# Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer
Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW) is a generative model developed for the purpose of producing realistic images in an unsupervised manner. DRAW uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an attention mechanism that sequentially generates an image by repeatedly adding detail to an initial image.The model consists of two RNNs, an encoder and a decoder, that communicate through an attention mechanism.
